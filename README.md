# React UI Accordion

Demo of an accordion UI component made in React. This uses GIPHY's API to populate each window with content. Made by [High Tops](https://hightops.co).

The accordion component also includes a ArrowIcon component to help express that it is a toggle-able component and also visually indicate whether the pane is open or closed.

Demo on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/austinnnnnnn/pen/xOJmgG).
